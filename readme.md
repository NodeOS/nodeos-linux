# nodeos-linux

Downloads Linux source for use with compiling parts of NodeOS

## Why?

Because multiple packages within NodeOS rely on kernel headers not found within
all operating systems (eg. OS X). This package simply downloads the Linux source
into a central location to be used by all packages.
